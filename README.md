# SQL Window Functions Skill Sprint

## Overview
This repository contains my Skill Sprint for MSBA 635, where I chose to learn **SQL Window Functions**. Window functions are powerful analytical tools used to calculate rankings, running totals, moving averages, and period‑over‑period comparisons without collapsing rows. They are essential for analytics, BI, and data engineering workflows.

## What This Repo Contains
- **implementation_plan.md** — My detailed learning plan, timeline, and objectives  
- **screenshot.png** — Proof of progress as I practiced SQL window functions  
- Additional practice files may be added as I continue learning  

## Why I Chose This Skill
SQL window functions are used in nearly every analytics role. They help answer questions about customer behavior, trends over time, and comparative performance. This skill directly supports the type of work done in churn modeling, segmentation, and business reporting.

## What I Learned
- How to use `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, and `DENSE_RANK()`  
- How to compare rows using `LAG()` and `LEAD()`  
- How to compute running totals and moving averages with `SUM() OVER()` and `AVG() OVER()`  
- How partitions and ordering affect analytical results  

## Tools Used
- SQL sandbox (Mode Analytics or similar)  
- Online tutorials and documentation
