# Skill Sprint Implementation Plan: Tableau Desktop (Superstore Dataset)

## Skill Chosen
**Tableau Desktop (13‑day trial)**

## Why I Chose This Skill
I chose Tableau because it is one of the most widely used tools for data visualization and business intelligence. It allows analysts to quickly explore data, identify trends, and communicate insights visually. Learning Tableau strengthens my ability to build dashboards and present analytical findings clearly and professionally.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this sprint, I will be able to:
- Connect Tableau Desktop to a dataset
- Build basic visualizations such as bar charts and line charts
- Use sorting, color, and filters to enhance clarity
- Create a dashboard that combines multiple charts
- Export or screenshot a completed dashboard for presentation

## Dataset
I used the **Superstore** dataset provided by Tableau.  
This dataset includes sales, profit, category, sub‑category, and customer information, making it ideal for practicing visual analytics.

## Resources I Will Use
- Tableau Desktop (13‑day trial)
- Tableau sample datasets
- Tableau training videos and documentation
- Online tutorials for basic Tableau skills
